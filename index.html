                    Ronnie Hart's life changes forever the day she dies—or
                    almost dies—saving her beloved dog, Rocco, from drowning.
                    Against all odds, modern medicine, sheer luck, and a touch
                    of fate give her a second chance. But coming back to life
                    doesn't mean picking up where she left off.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Haunted by memories of what could have been and consumed by
                    regrets she can't seem to shake, Ronnie struggles to find
                    her footing in the world she almost left behind. In a
                    desperate bid for redemption, she and Rocco embark on a road
                    trip of atonement, retracing the steps of her past mistakes
                    and seeking closure.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    As miles roll by and Ronnie confronts the people and
                    decisions she left behind, she begins to realize her
                    greatest regret isn't what she thought it was. With time
                    running out, she must decide to return to the past or
                    abandon it forever - a choice that could cost her
                    everything.

                    Fifteen years ago, Kelly Bowers fled Riverton, Virginia,
                    leaving behind a troubled home and a life she couldn't wait
                    to escape. Now, a family health scare forces her back to her
                    childhood town, along with her teenage daughter, Daisy,
                    reopening old wounds Kelly thought she'd buried forever.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    For Daisy, Riverton is an exciting mystery. Her mother has
                    always avoided talking about her past, and Daisy sees this
                    trip as her chance to uncover the secrets Kelly has
                    carefully hidden—starting with the identity of her father.
                    But the deeper Daisy digs into her mother's life, the more
                    questions she uncovers, including the significance of the
                    hidden pond Kelly forbids her to visit.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    As Kelly grapples with the memories she's spent years
                    suppressing, Daisy grows closer to uncovering the truth
                    about her family and her roots. When tensions between them
                    boil over, both mother and daughter are forced to confront
                    their pasts and decide whether they can build a future
                    together.
